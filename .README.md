## JSON Endpoint for GHCR Badges

Makes the pull count badge possible for these ghcr.io packages:

If we don't yet follow an image, you can either:

* open an issue or pull request to add it to the master `pkg.txt` and/or
* make a fork to start your own.

### Custom Badges

To make a badge, you can modify one of the badges above or generate one with something like [shields.io](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) and these parameters:

#### URL

```markdown
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipitio/ghcr-pulls/master/index.json
```

#### JSONPath

You can show either a pretty value like 12K or the raw number like 12345.

##### Pretty Count

```markdown
$[?(@.owner=="<USER>" && @.repo=="<REPO>" && @.image=="<IMAGE>")].pulls
```

##### Raw Count

```markdown
$[?(@.owner=="<USER>" && @.repo=="<REPO>" && @.image=="<IMAGE>")].raw_pulls
```

### Further Study

GHCR itself doesn't provide an API endpoint for the pull count, so Github Packages is scraped twice daily for every image in `pkg.txt`. In addition to the latest stats, the index also contains a history of the raw pull counts for each image, starting on 2024-06-10, should you find that useful or interesting. Should the pulls for each tag be kept individually as well?
