Wish you could show npm, gem, mvn, Gradle, NuGet, or GHCR badges? Tough luck; the GitHub Packages API has never exposed the publicly-available metadata that other registries provide, like pulls... That is, until now: **Star this project to have GitHub supplement its API with an additional endpoint for your public packages!**

A service ran by GitHub will add them to its circular priority queue within the next few hours and update the [closed-loop system](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/releases/latest). If you'd then like the service to forget and ignore some or all of your packages, add `owner[/repo[/package]]` to `optout.txt` [here](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/edit/master/optout.txt) and make a pull request.

To add any other users or organizations not yet [in the index](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/tree/index), add the case-sensitive name of each one on a new line in `owners.txt` on your own fork [here](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/edit/master/owners.txt) and make a pull request. Please add just the name(s) -- ids, repos, and packages will be found automatically!

Once you've confirmed that the packages you're interested in are found and their metadata update without issue, you can create an independent instance for them that'll update much more frequently (every hour or so) by creating a fork of just the `master` branch and enabling Actions from its tab. While you can update your `optout.txt` immediately, please wait for the [Alternative URL](#alternative-url) in your fork to change to yours before adding any other users or organizations to your `owners.txt`. This centralized repo will then serve as a backup.

## The Endpoint

```py
https://ipitio.github.io/backage/OWNER/REPO/PACKAGE.FORMAT
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO/PACKAGE.FORMAT` with their respective values, then use something like [shields.io/json](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) or [shields.io/xml](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-xml-badge) to access the latest data and make badges like `refreshes` above or the one [here](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/5594#issuecomment-2157626147).

> [!NOTE]
> The format can be either `json` or `xml`. You'll need the XML endpoint to evaluate expressions, like filters, with Shields -- see [this issue](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/issues/23).

> [!TIP]
> Use the proxy to convert external JSON to XML! This doesn't currently work with Shields, though.

You'll find these properties for the package and its versions:

</details>

They can be queried with the following paths:

<details>

<summary>JSON</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```js
$.PROPERTY
```

```js
$.size
```

Versions may be filtered in and tags out:

```js
$.version[FILTER].PROPERTY
```

```js
$.version[?(@.latest)].tags[?(@!="latest")]
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>XML</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```py
/xml/PROPERTY
```

```py
/xml/size
```

Versions can be filtered in and tags out:

```py
/xml/version[FILTER]/PROPERTY
```

```py
/xml/version[./latest[.="true"]]/tags[.!="latest"]
```

</details>

### Alternative URL

```py
https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/raw/index/OWNER/REPO/PACKAGE.FORMAT
```

The endpoint is also available at this URL that doesn't rely on Pages.

## JSON2XML Proxy

```py
https://ipitio.github.io/backage?json=https://URL/ENCODED/JSON
```

Use your own JSON endpoint with this proxy to convert it into XML. Try it out in your browser:

**<<https://ipitio.github.io/backage?json=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/><GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/index/.json>**
