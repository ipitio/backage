Ever wish you could show npm, gem, mvn, Gradle, NuGet, or GHCR badges for GitHub Packages? Or just query for the download counts? This endpoint makes that possible, using only free GitHub resources; the API doesn't, and has never, exposed the public metadata that other registries provide.

## Getting Started

If this is [`ipitio/backage`](https://github.com/ipitio/backage), all you have to do is **star the repo to get your public packages added!** The service's circular priority queue will update the [closed-loop system](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/releases/latest) with them within the next few hours. Additionally watching and forking the repo, and following the owner, are ways to increase their priority. Yes, I know, but these are the graphs GitHub has available.

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure your profile is [public](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/issues/34#issuecomment-2968850773) so that this repo can see your packages.

Otherwise, if this is a fork, you'd prefer an alternative method, or your packages weren't added to the [index](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/tree/index) after a day, enter the case-sensitive name of each missing user or organization on a new line at the top of the queue, `owners.txt`, [here](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/edit/master/owners.txt) and make a pull request. Don't worry -- while my Contribution Graph is an uptime monitor of sorts, yours won't be. See the top of `bkg.sh` for details about available options, which must come last when passed to `update.sh`, as shown in `Self-Host` below.

> [!TIP]
> You only need to add names to the queue; IDs are fetched as needed and entries are removed once processed.

New packages won't be added until *all* existing ones are refreshed; you should also create an independent instance that'll update faster and more frequently. Simply fork just the `master` branch, choose one of the following options, and use the [Alternative URL](#alternative-url) when it changes. This centralized repo will then serve as a backup for all subsets of packages not in `optout.txt`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your own packages will be picked up automatically! If you need to edit `owners.txt`, do so after the first run.

<summary>With Actions</summary>

This will use a lot of minutes on GitHub-hosted runners, so you may want to use your own.

1. Enable Actions from its tab
2. Enable all disabled workflows

<details>
<summary>Self-Host</summary>

This is an example for `systemd`; adapt it to your needs. Please note:

- Docker needs to be installed
- You don't need to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` if you first log in with `gh` or use your PAT to run:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 -b <GITHUB_BRANCH> --single-branch [https|ssh]://<PAT>@github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO> /opt/<GITHUB_REPO>/<GITHUB_BRANCH>
```

- `-m 0` ensures only the public packages of the owners you've added are updated (default)
  - You'll need the proper permissions to update private packages
- `-d 0` allows everything to be updated in one go
  - A graceful restart is initiated every 4.5 hours by default

```bash
echo "[Unit]
Description=Run Backage
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

  GITHUB_REPO=<GITHUB_REPO>                       ;\\
  GITHUB_BRANCH=<GITHUB_BRANCH>                      ;\\
  BKG_PATH=\$GITHUB_REPO/\$GITHUB_BRANCH    ;\\
  mkdir -p /opt/\$BKG_PATH                  ;\\
  docker run -v /opt/\$BKG_PATH:/app         \\

    ghcr.io/\$GITHUB_OWNER/\${BKG_PATH////:} \\
    src/test/update.sh -m 0 -d 0'

## The Endpoint

```py
https://ipitio.github.io/backage/OWNER/[REPO/[PACKAGE]].FORMAT
```

Once the packages you're interested in have been added, replace the parameters with their respective values, scoping to your parsing needs, then access the latest data however you want. The format can be either `json` or `xml`.

> [!NOTE]
> Use something like [shields.io/json](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) or [shields.io/xml](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-xml-badge) to make badges like [this one](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/5594#issuecomment-2157626147). You'll need the latter to evaluate expressions, like filters ([issue](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/issues/23)).

### Query Syntax

<details>

<summary>JSON</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```js
$.PROPERTY
```

```js
$.size
```

Versions may be filtered in and tags out:

```js
$.version[FILTER].PROPERTY
```

```js
$.version[?(@.latest)].tags[?(@!="latest")]
```

As can packages in `owner[/repo]/.json` files:

```js
$.[FILTER].PROPERTY
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>XML</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```py
//PROPERTY
```

```py
//size
```

Versions can be filtered in and tags out:

```py
//version[FILTER]/PROPERTY
```

```py
//version[./latest[.="true"]]/tags[.!="latest"]
```

As can packages in `owner[/repo]/.xml` files:

```py
//package[FILTER]/PROPERTY
```

</details>

### Alternative URL

```py
https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/raw/index/OWNER/[REPO/[PACKAGE]].FORMAT
```

The endpoint is also available here! This will change to your fork once it updates.

## Bring Your Own JSON

```py
https://ipitio.github.io/backage?json=https://URL/ENCODED/JSON
```

While this doesn't directly work with Shields, you can BYOJ to convert into XML.  Try it out in your browser:

**<https://ipitio.github.io/backage?json=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/index/.json>**
