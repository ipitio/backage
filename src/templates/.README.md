Wish you could show npm, gem, mvn, Gradle, NuGet, or GHCR badges? Or just query for the download counts? This endpoint makes that possible, using only free GitHub resources; the GitHub Packages API doesn't, and has never, exposed the publicly-available metadata that other registries provide.

## The Endpoint

```py
https://ipitio.github.io/backage/OWNER/[REPO/[PACKAGE]].FORMAT
```

If this is [`ipitio/backage`](https://github.com/ipitio/backage), all you have to do is **star the repo to have GitHub generate this additional endpoint for your public packages!** A service ran by GitHub will add them to its circular priority queue within the next few hours and update the [closed-loop system](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/releases/latest). Additionally watching and forking the repo, and following the owner, are ways to increase your priority. Yes, I know, but these are the signals that can be automatically processed. Otherwise, if this is a fork or you'd prefer an alternative method, see [below](#manual-actions).

Once added, replace the parameters above with their respective values, scoping to your parsing needs, then access the latest data however you want. Use something like [shields.io/json](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) or [shields.io/xml](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-xml-badge) to make badges like the ones you just scrolled past or the one [here](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/5594#issuecomment-2157626147).

> [!NOTE]
> The format can be either `json` or `xml`. You'll need the XML endpoint to evaluate expressions, like filters, with Shields -- see [this issue](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/issues/23).

> [!TIP]
> Use the proxy to convert external JSON to XML! This doesn't currently work with Shields, though.

</details>

They can be queried with the following paths:

<details>

<summary>JSON</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```js
$.PROPERTY
```

```js
$.size
```

Versions may be filtered in and tags out:

```js
$.version[FILTER].PROPERTY
```

```js
$.version[?(@.latest)].tags[?(@!="latest")]
```

As can packages in `owner[/repo]/.json` files:

```js
$.[FILTER].PROPERTY
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>XML</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```py
/xml/PROPERTY
```

```py
/xml/size
```

Versions can be filtered in and tags out:

```py
/xml/version[FILTER]/PROPERTY
```

```py
/xml/version[./latest[.="true"]]/tags[.!="latest"]
```

As can packages in `owner[/repo]/.xml` files:

```py
/xml/package[FILTER]/PROPERTY
```

</details>

### Manual Actions

To add any other users or organizations not yet [in the index](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/tree/index), add the case-sensitive name of each one on a new line at the top of `owners.txt` on your own fork [here](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/edit/master/owners.txt) and make a pull request. Please add just the name(s) -- ids, repos, and packages will be found automatically! If you'd like the service to forget and ignore any subset of packages, add `owner[/repo[/package]]` to `optout.txt` [here](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/edit/master/optout.txt) and make a pull request.

You can create an independent instance for them that'll update faster and more frequently. Simply fork just the `master` branch, then enable Actions from its tab and all disabled workflows. Your own packages will be picked up automatically! If you previously had to edit the `txt` files, you can do so again after the first run. I recommend that you first confirm here that the packages you're interested in are picked up without issue. This centralized repo will then serve as a backup.

### Alternative URL

```py
https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/raw/index/OWNER/[REPO/[PACKAGE]].FORMAT
```

The endpoint is also available here!

## JSON2XML Proxy

```py
https://ipitio.github.io/backage?json=https://URL/ENCODED/JSON
```

Use your own JSON endpoint with this proxy to convert it into XML. Try it out in your browser:

**<https://ipitio.github.io/backage?json=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/index/.json>**
